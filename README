This program attempts to list (and count) every possible 8
symbol nerdle problem.

__  __  __  __  __  __  __  __

Each __ is a character from 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, +, -, /, * and =
With a number of rules surrounding the selection, for example, the equation
has to be valid, i.e.
 8  +    7   -   2   =   1   3

See nerdlegame.com for specific information about the game and the goals of this
program, but the rules of the game are:

Rules (from nerdlegame.com)

    Each guess is a calculation.
    You can use 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 + - * / or =.
    It must contain one “=”.
    It must only have a number to the right of the “=”, not another calculation.
    Standard order of operations applies, so calculate * and / before + and - 
        eg. 3+2*5=13 not 25!
    If the answer we're looking for is 10+20=30, then we will accept 20+10=30 too 
       (unless you turn off 'commutative answers' in settings).
